PCA:
	We aim at the lowest number of components that yield a high fidelity image as to respect CNN minimal use of features that yield a reconstructable image at the bottleneck

Results in the differences between vectors
we expect then that bai's novel data will be further from the actual images used for training than the UMCG used for testing.

P-value > Î±: The differences between the medians are not statistically significant
    If the p-value is greater than the significance level, you do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the group medians are all equal.
